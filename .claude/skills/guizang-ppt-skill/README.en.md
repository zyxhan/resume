An agent skill for Claude Code, Codex, and similar coding-agent environments. It generates **single-file HTML horizontal-swipe decks**, deck visuals, and social cover pages.

It ships with two visual systems:

- **Style A: editorial magazine × electronic ink**. Picture *Monocle* with code stitched in. Best for narrative talks, opinions, salons, and personal voice.
- **Style B: Swiss International Typographic Style**. Grid-first, one high-saturation anchor color, sharp rectangles, hairline rules, and extreme type contrast. Best for facts, products, analysis, and frameworks.

> Distilled by [Guizang](https://x.com/op7418) from offline talks like "One-Person Company: Organizations Folded by AI" and "A New Way of Working." Every pitfall hit during those decks is logged in `checklist.md`.
> Sponsor and supporter details are listed in [SPONSORS.md](./SPONSORS.md).

## 30-second start

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill --skill guizang-ppt-skill
```

Or paste this to an AI agent with shell access:

```text
Install guizang-ppt-skill for me. Clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill into ~/.claude/skills/guizang-ppt-skill, then verify that SKILL.md, assets/, and references/ exist.
```

If you already installed it, update with:

```text
Update guizang-ppt-skill for me. Go to ~/.claude/skills/guizang-ppt-skill, run git pull, then tell me the latest commit.
```

Then ask your agent:

```text
Create a Swiss-style deck from this article, around 7 slides, with 2-3 generated visuals.
```

Other useful prompts:

```text
Turn this Markdown file into an editorial magazine-style presentation.
Create a 21:9 social cover from the core idea of this deck.
Redesign this product screenshot as a 16:10 slide visual.
```

## What you get

- 🖋 **Two visual systems**: editorial storytelling for Style A, factual Swiss structure for Style B
- 📐 **Horizontal swipe navigation**: ← → arrows / scroll wheel / touch swipe / bottom dots / ESC for index
- 🧩 **Style A 10 layouts**: cover, divider, big numbers, image/text, image grid, pipeline, comparison, and more
- 🧱 **Style B 22 locked layouts**: Cover, Statement, KPI Tower, Loop Diagram, Duo Compare, Image Hero, Closing Manifesto, and more
- 🎨 **Curated theme presets**: 5 electronic-ink themes for Style A, 4 Swiss anchor-color themes for Style B
- 🖼 **Optional Codex image flow**: generate documentary photos, infographics, flow diagrams, system maps, and UI scenes with GPT-Image 2.0 / GPT-M 2.0, then insert them at template-safe ratios
- 📰 **Social covers**: generate 21:9 WeChat cover images, 1:1 share cards, 3:4 Xiaohongshu covers, video thumbnails, and related variants
- 📴 **Low-power static mode**: press `B` to turn WebGL / canvas animation into static visuals
- 📄 **Single HTML file** — no build, no server, open directly in the browser

## Fits / Doesn't fit

**✅ Fits**: offline talks, industry keynotes, private salons, AI product launches, demo day, presentations with strong personal voice

**❌ Doesn't fit**: data-heavy tables, training decks (density too low), multi-user collaborative editing (static HTML)

## Common use cases

| Task | Recommended flow |
|------|------------------|
| Long article to talk deck | Extract the core argument, then build a 6-10 slide rhythm |
| Framework / product analysis | Use Style B Swiss with locked layouts and 21:9 hero visuals |
| Personal talk / opinion piece | Use Style A editorial magazine for stronger narrative rhythm |
| Deck visuals | In Codex, generate photos, infographics, flow diagrams, system maps, or UI scenes |
| Social covers | Generate 21:9 main covers, 1:1 share cards, 3:4 vertical covers, and video thumbnails from the same idea |
| Screenshot normalization | Redesign raw screenshots into template-safe ratios before inserting them into slides |

## Why HTML decks

- **Agent-native editing**: HTML / CSS is plain text, so agents can read, edit, and validate it directly.
- **Higher visual density than Markdown**: precise layout, positioning, motion, interactivity, and cover formats.
- **Lightweight delivery**: one HTML file can be opened, presented, sent, screenshotted, or recorded.
- **Better quality gates**: the Swiss validator can catch layout drift, unsafe image placement, centered body titles, and SVG text traps.
- **One visual system across outputs**: decks, generated visuals, covers, and screenshot redesigns can share the same style rules.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | Supported | Native Skill workflow for creating and iterating HTML decks |
| Codex | Supported | Good for deck generation, image generation, and browser-based visual QA |
| Cursor / other local agents | Works | Requires filesystem access and shell execution |
| WorkBuddy | In adaptation | Marketplace-ready version is being prepared separately |
| Plain chatbot | Not recommended | Without filesystem and browser preview, full deck generation is hard to stabilize |

## Install

### Option 1: One-line install (recommended)

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill --skill guizang-ppt-skill
```

### Option 2: Paste this to an AI

> Install the `guizang-ppt-skill` Claude Code skill for me. Steps:
>
> 1. Make sure `~/.claude/skills/` exists (create if not)
> 2. Run `git clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/guizang-ppt-skill`
> 3. Verify: `ls ~/.claude/skills/guizang-ppt-skill/` should show `SKILL.md`, `assets/`, `references/`
> 4. Tell me when done. Later, saying things like "make me a magazine-style deck" will trigger this skill.

Paste the block above into Claude Code / Cursor / any AI agent with shell access and it handles the install.

### Option 3: Manual CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/op7418/guizang-ppt-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/guizang-ppt-skill
```

### How to trigger it

Once installed, Claude Code auto-detects the skill. Trigger phrases:

- "Make me a magazine-style deck"
- "Make me a Swiss-style deck"
- "Generate a horizontal swipe deck"
- "Editorial magazine style presentation"
- "Electronic ink slides for my talk"
- "Create a 21:9 WeChat cover from this article"
- "Create a 1:1 share card from this deck"

## Workflow

The skill is a structured workflow; the agent walks you through each step:

1. **Choose style** — Style A editorial magazine, or Style B Swiss International
2. **Clarify intent** — 7-question checklist: style, audience, duration, source material, images/screenshots, theme, hard constraints
3. **Copy template** — Style A uses `assets/template.html`; Style B uses `assets/template-swiss.html`
4. **Fill content** — create a rhythm plan, then choose and adapt the matching layout skeletons
5. **Optional image generation** — in Codex, ask whether to use GPT-Image 2.0 / GPT-M 2.0 images, then insert them at page-appropriate ratios
6. **Self-check** — match against `references/checklist.md`; P0 issues must all pass; Swiss decks must also pass the layout validator
7. **Preview** — open the HTML in a browser
8. **Iterate** — use inline styles to tune font size, height, spacing

Full spec in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

## Style B Swiss

The Swiss theme is a strict layout system, not just a CSS skin.

- **22 named layouts**: body slides must use `S01` to `S22`; do not invent new structures
- **4 anchor colors**: International Klein Blue, lemon yellow, lemon green, safety orange
- **Grid lock**: 16-column grid, sharp rectangles, 1px hairlines, no shadows, no gradients, no rounded cards
- **Chinese title scaling**: all-Chinese headlines should be one step smaller to preserve space for content and images
- **Image/text bottom alignment**: text and image blocks should align at the bottom in left/right image layouts, while staying clear of pagination controls
- **Image slots**: images must sit in template-defined `data-image-slot` regions, often generated at 21:9 or 16:10
- **Hard validation**: the validator catches centered body titles, experimental layouts, visible SVG text, and images placed outside slots

Swiss validation:

```bash
node scripts/validate-swiss-deck.mjs path/to/index.html
```

## Codex Image Flow

In Codex, after the first deck draft is ready, the agent can ask whether the user wants generated visuals. Once confirmed, choose an image type or style. Common types include:

- Documentary photos: Fuji / Leica-like real-world scenes that add human texture
- Infographics / flow diagrams / comparison charts / system maps: for concepts that cannot be explained well with photos
- Screenshot framing / screenshot redesigns: preserve raw screenshots with bundled background assets and a CleanShot X-style canvas first; use UI scene generation only when the screenshot needs reconstruction
- Data posters / charts: turn key numbers into insert-ready visual assets
- Multi-image compositions: useful for ultra-wide slots where three unrelated 16:9 images would break the grid

Generated images must follow four core rules:

- Treat the image as an embedded asset, not a standalone slide: no footer, page bottom, title, page number, corner mark, signature, or decorative border
- Match the deck language: Chinese decks use Chinese labels inside infographics, English decks use English labels
- Match the slot ratio before generation: 21:9 for many Swiss hero slots, 16:9 / 16:10 for common main visuals, 16:10 for UI scenes, fixed equal heights for image grids
- When a raw screenshot must stay faithful, read `references/screenshot-framing.md` first and use bundled `assets/screenshot-backgrounds/` backgrounds plus programmatic scaling, padding, and alignment instead of redrawing the screenshot by default

Image prompts live in [`references/image-prompts.md`](./references/image-prompts.md). Screenshot framing lives in [`references/screenshot-framing.md`](./references/screenshot-framing.md).

## Cover Generation

The skill can also turn an article or deck idea into platform covers:

- **WeChat main cover**: 21:9, headline-first, with one visual anchor
- **WeChat share card**: 1:1, visually paired with the 21:9 cover
- **Xiaohongshu cover / carousel**: 3:4, large title, consistent type scale across a batch
- **Video thumbnail**: 16:9, title + subtitle + one focal visual

The same rule applies: use a few strong keywords, keep the title as the visual center, and do not fill the canvas with body copy.

## Example prompts

Copy any of these prompts into your agent, then attach your article, Markdown file, or image assets:

```text
Create an 8-slide Swiss-style deck from this article, with 3 generated visuals matched to the template image slots.
```

```text
Turn this product analysis document into an editorial magazine-style deck with a strong narrative rhythm.
```

```text
From this deck's core idea, create two covers: a 21:9 main cover and a visually paired 1:1 share card.
```

```text
Redesign these product screenshots into consistent 16:10 slide visuals. Preserve key UI information; do not add slide titles or footers inside the images.
```

If the user asks for a Swiss-style deck without specifying color, default to International Klein Blue.

## Core design principles

1. **Restraint over flash** — WebGL backgrounds only bleed through on hero pages
2. **Structure over decoration** — information hierarchy via type size + typeface + grid whitespace, not shadows or floating cards
3. **Images are first-class citizens** — align them with the body content area, keep ratios stable, crop only from the bottom, and preserve top/sides
4. **Generated visuals are assets** — keep only the core photo / chart / UI; do not render slide titles, footers, or corner marks inside the image
5. **Rhythm lives on hero pages** — hero / non-hero alternation keeps the eye from fatiguing
6. **Dynamic effects must be optional** — `B` toggles static mode so animation never becomes a reading burden
7. **Terms stay consistent** — Skills is Skills; no mix-and-match translations
8. **Swiss layouts stay locked** — Style B should restore and reuse the original 22-page layout system instead of inventing unrelated pages

- Improve screenshot redesign and infographic generation workflows
- Prepare marketplace-specific variants such as WorkBuddy
- Add more curated theme packs while keeping custom colors restricted

## FAQ

**Can it export to PPTX?**
The main output is HTML. You can present it in a browser, screenshot it, or record it. PPTX conversion can be done as a separate workflow, but it is not the core path today.

**Why are custom colors not allowed?**
The skill is designed for stable visual output. Arbitrary colors often break the system, so decks must use curated presets.

**Can I add my own layout?**
Yes. Style A layouts can be extended in `references/layouts.md`. Style B is stricter: update `template-swiss.html`, `layouts-swiss.md`, `swiss-layout-lock.md`, and the validator together.

**Is Codex image generation required?**
No. Decks work without generated images. The image flow is only used when you need photos, infographics, UI scenes, or covers.

**How do I update the skill?**
Run the install command again, or run `git pull` inside your local skill directory.

## Contributing

Bugs, layout issues, new layout requests — Issues and PRs welcome. Prioritize:

- Add new classes to `template.html` first; don't let `layouts.md` reference undefined classes
- When changing `template-swiss.html`, update `layouts-swiss.md` and `swiss-layout-lock.md` together
- When adding Swiss rules, update `scripts/validate-swiss-deck.mjs`
- Log pitfalls into `checklist.md` at the matching P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 tier
- New theme colors go into `themes.md` with a recommended use case
